election-map
============

This is a web app that displays an interactive 'slippy' map of South African election results. It uses [TileStache](http://tilestache.org/) to serve vector geography tiles (representing municipalities, wards, etc.) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plus Glenn Robertson's [GeoJSON Tile Layer](https://github.com/glenrobertson/leaflet-tilelayer-geojson) to display the map.
